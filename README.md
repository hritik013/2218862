# React URL Shortener Web App

## Overview
This is a user-friendly URL Shortener application built with React and Material UI. It allows users to shorten URLs, manage custom shortcodes, set expiry times, and view detailed analytics for each short linkâ€”all managed on the client side. All logging is handled via a custom middleware and sent to a remote logging API with authentication.

## Features
- **Shorten up to 5 URLs at once**
- **Custom shortcodes** (alphanumeric, unique, 4-12 chars)
- **Set validity period** (in minutes, default 30)
- **Client-side validation** for URLs, shortcodes, and validity
- **Short URL redirection** handled via client-side routing
- **Statistics page** with:
  - Short URL, original URL, creation/expiry times
  - Total click count
  - Click details: timestamp, referrer, geo-location
- **All actions and errors logged** via a custom logger (no console.log)
- **Material UI** for a modern, clean interface
- **Data persistence** using localStorage

## Setup & Running
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage
- **Shorten URLs:**
  - Enter up to 5 long URLs.
  - Optionally set validity (minutes) and/or a custom shortcode.
  - Click "Shorten URLs" to generate short links.
- **Redirection:**
  - Click a short URL to be redirected to the original URL. Each click is logged with timestamp, referrer, and geo-location.
- **View Analytics:**
  - Go to the Statistics page to see all shortened URLs and detailed click analytics.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Invalid inputs, expired links, and duplicate shortcodes are handled with user-friendly messages.

## Logging Middleware
- All logs are sent to a remote API with a Bearer token (see `src/middleware/logger.js`).
- No use of `console.log` or browser logging anywhere in the app.

## Tech Stack
- **React** (Vite)
- **Material UI**
- **React Router**
- **Custom Logging Middleware**

## Notes
- The app is designed to run only on `http://localhost:3000`.
- All data is stored in localStorage for persistence across sessions.
- For geo-location, a public IP API is used on each redirect.

## Clearing Data
To reset all shortened URLs and analytics, clear the `shortUrlMap` key from your browser's localStorage.
